# Open source roadmap

This is the open source roadmap for [Open Raven](https://www.openraven.com). Engineering is done by our Corvus Security Research team, a full-time research and development team that focus is cloud and data security. You can browse all of our work at the[Corvus Security Research landing page] (https://csr.openraven.com), coming soon.

We welcome all contributions to our open source tools from feedback, bug reports and pull-requests. Tasks and individual issues for specific projects are managed in the project repos themselves.

In this repository, you can find the [official Corvus Security Research open source roadmap](https://github.com/openraven/open-source-roadmap/projects/1). Our product roadmap is where you can learn about tools and features we're working on, features we are planning , what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **the tool** that indicates the tool itself.

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the tool to which the item belongs. For a list of current tool areas, see below.

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs.

- One or more **environments** (AWS, GCP etc).

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed.

## Release phases

Releases are set in each project at the repo level. A release includes the planned feature along with the planned release date.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every tools or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next.

## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

- **cloud discovery** Discovering and tracking assets and services running in AWS, GCP and Azure
- **cloud security posture management** security configurations of cloud providers and their services such as AWS S3
- **data store security posture management** security configurations of databases, data warehouses and data lakes
- **attack surface management** Discovering and tracking assets that are exposed to attackers such as on the perimeter or those open to the Internet 
- **application and data store identification** Techniques to identify technologies deployed in cloud environments such as non-native data stores
- **data generation** tools to generate 'impotent' sensitive data that can be safely used for development and testing
- **compliance:** security compliance with regulations such as GDPR and PCI
